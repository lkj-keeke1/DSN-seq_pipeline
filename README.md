# DSN-seq_pipeline

## Background
In flower plants, RNA editing only exists in mitochondrial and chloroplast transcriptomes, resulting in C-to-U base editing in RNA sequences.

C-to-U RNA editing can result in creation of start codon (ATG) and stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) or amino acid change, and is very important for the normal function of organellar genes in plants.

However, without poly(A) tail, the organellar transcriptomes can not be enriched in mRNA-seq library.

This project aimed at verifying the capability of two high-throughput sequencing methods——DSN-seq and Ribo-off-seq——in profiling RNA editing events in plant organellar transcriptomes. These two methods enrich organellar transcriptome information by reducing rRNA content in plant total RNA.
